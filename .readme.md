## PROCESS DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROJECT
So I made use of REACT.JS in developing this application. I developed states that will hold each data we are operating

### State Variables
kirpichtimeconc: This is a state variable initialized as an empty array []. It will hold the calculated Kirpich time concentrations (Tc values).

kirpichlength: This state variable is initialized as null and will store the user-input length for the Kirpich calculation.

kirpichslope: This state variable is initialized as null and will store the user-input slope for the Kirpich calculation.

scstimeconc: This state variable is initialized as 0 and is not used in the provided function but might be used elsewhere in your component for the SCS method.

scslength and scsslope: These are initialized as null and might be used elsewhere for storing length and slope values related to the SCS method.


After developing these state variables, I created a function that will find the kirpich time of concentration

## calculateKirpichTime Function
So I created a function which calculates the time of concentration using the Kirpich formula for different lengths and slopes and stores the results in the kirpichtimeconc state variable.

### So I took the following steps:
1. Parsing Inputs: (So the data I get form the string are always string, and string cannot be use for mathematical operation so I uhave to change them to numbers)

L is the parsed numeric value of kirpichlength.
S is the parsed numeric value of kirpichslope.
maxTcValues is set to 200, which is the maximum number of Tc values the function will calculate.
2. Setting up of the loop
The loop structure consists of two nested loops: an outer loop that iterates over the slopes and an inner loop that iterates over the lengths. Here's how each part works:

A. Outer Loop:
for (let slope of slopes) {

Purpose: The outer loop iterates through each slope value in the slopes array. This array contains all the slope values starting from the initial slope (S) up to 0.2, incremented by 0.001.
Iteration Variable: slope, which represents the current slope value being processed in the loop.

B. Inner Loop
for (let length of lengths) {

Purpose: The inner loop iterates through each length value in the lengths array. This array contains all the length values starting from the initial length (L) up to 100, incremented by 0.5.
Iteration Variable: length, which represents the current length value being processed in the loop.

### Calculation and Data Collection
1. Within the inner loop, the calculation of Tc WAS performed for each combination of slope and length:
Check the formular
2. Round up the value to 3 decimal plac:data.push(`Tc-${length}=${Tc.toFixed(3)}`);

2. Loop Exit Condition: if (tcCount >= slopes?.length - 1) break outerLoop;

Purpose: This condition checks if the number of Tc values calculated (tcCount) has reached the length of the slopes array minus one. If so, it exits both loops early by breaking the outerLoop label.
Reasoning: This ensures that the loop doesn't calculate more Tc values than necessary and provides an early exit when the required number of calculations is reached.

### WHY I USE REACT
1. Virtual DOM for Efficient Updates: So updates are easily seen without refreshing the DOM
2. Simple to user: Allows me to create a simple user interface for the projects
